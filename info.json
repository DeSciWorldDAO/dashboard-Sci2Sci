"description":"At Sci2Sci, we are building an electronic lab notebook and a publishing platform in one interface. This will allow us to store all experimental data and metadata in one place, and quickly release it in public access with one click. In a nutshell, we offer full stack data publishing - from the experiment planning through raw data acquisition and analysis to the final research report - all in a single platform, with digital CVs containing all history of individual contributions.",
